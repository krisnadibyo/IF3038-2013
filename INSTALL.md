Installation
============

Running under a webserver is preferred since IE has a problem with local storage when
running under local path (without webserver);

Run the install script first (install.html), click the button there to initialize or
reinitialize the local storage.

After the initialization, you may create a new user and create your tasks, or use
a pre-intialized user (username: fitzhugh, password: chickenrice)
